# Task List

I've seen a hundred different to do lists. Write a task, clear it and it's gone. But what if you wanted to go back to that task. What if your coworker asks you to update a program, then weeks later they want another update but forget the program, and you forget too. What if your boss wants a monthly report of your projects, wouldn't it be great to pull up your to do lists from that period?

That's what this task list does. View outstanding tasks, view completed tasks, look up tasks by keyword, or by date range.
